## I. Objectives and Activities

**Objective:** 
Our objective is to create statistical models from the [Global Terrorism Database](https://www.kaggle.com/START-UMD/gtd) data set for the purposes of prediction and inference. 

**Data Set:**
The *Global Terrorism Database* contains over 180,000 observations and 135 variables. Each observation corresponds to a terrorism incident that occurred between 1970 and 2017. The type of information available for each incident is very diverse, including (but not limited to) the following:

1. *Date Variables* (Year, Month, Day, etc.)
2. *Geospatial Variables* (Lat/Long, Region, Country, City, Province, etc.)
3. *Incident Descriptive Variables* (Attack Type, Duration of Incident, Success/Failure, Weapons Used, Targets, etc.)
4. *Perpetrator Descriptive Variables* (Terrorist group membership, # Perpetrators, etc.)
5. *Casuality and Damage Variables* (# Fatalities, # Injured, etc.) 

The diversity of the variables in this data set lends itself to a variety of research directions, and supports the creation of numerous regression and categorical models.

Specific research questions are discussed in the next section, along with the principal investigator assigned to each question. Proposed solutions and methods of evaluation will differ depending on the nature of each question, and will be discussed individually in the context of each research topic.

## IV. Potential Difficulties
Preliminary analysis of the dataset has revealed that the data is sparsely populated and will require a significant amount of data cleansing before it will be usable.
