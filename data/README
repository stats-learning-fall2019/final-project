Publications
The GTD has been leveraged extensively in scholarly publications, reports, and media articles. Putting Terrorism in Context: Lessons from the Global Terrorism Database, by GTD principal investigators LaFree, Dugan, and Miller investigates patterns of terrorism and provides perspective on the challenges of data collection and analysis. The GTD's data collection manager, Michael Jensen, discusses important Benefits and Drawbacks of Methodological Advancements in Data Collection and Coding.

Training
START has released the first in a series of training modules designed to equip GTD users with the knowledge and tools to best leverage the database. This training module provides a general overview of the GTD, including the data collection process, uses of the GTD, and patterns of global terrorism. Participants will learn basic data handling and how to generate summary statistics from the GTD using PivotTables in Microsoft Excel.
